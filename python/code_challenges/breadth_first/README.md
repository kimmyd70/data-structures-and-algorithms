Developer: Kim Damalas

## PR for this file: https://github.com/kimmyd70/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/71

This is code challenge 36 of 401-Python (seattle-py-401n2)

Date: 31 March 2021
____________________
### Challenge 

Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

____________

## Approach & Efficiency

Approach is using Nodes, Classes


Time:   O(n) -- traverse the entire graph 

Space:  O(1) -- return list

_____________
## Required Testing

Test edge case: empty graph

Also:
happy path
obvious failure
