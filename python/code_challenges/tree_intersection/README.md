# Tree Intersection

Developer: Kim Damalas

## PR for this file: https://github.com/kimmyd70/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/66

This is code challenge 32 of 401-Python (seattle-py-401n2)

Date: 18 March 2021
____________________
### Challenge 

1. Find common values in 2 binary trees

2. Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.

3. Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

____________

## Approach & Efficiency

Approach is using Nodes, Classes, and `if` comparisons


Time:   O(n) -- traverse the entire tree 

Space:  O(n) -- building a return array with as many as n values

_____________
## Required Testing

No tests required from CC#32 assignment, but write unit test to capture:
1. happy path
2. known failure
3. edge cases (empty tree, one node tree, 3 node tree all same value, negative numbers present; float values will behave the same as int because of python operator defaults)
